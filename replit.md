## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The website uses a professional blue and white color scheme, with Montserrat for headings and Open Sans for body text. It follows a mobile-first approach for responsive design. Shadcn UI components are customized to ensure a consistent and modern look. The site features 18 distinct pages covering services, projects, safety, and testimonials, with a recent focus on a condensed and modernized homepage design, following a minimal, professional style inspired by Rock Spring Contracting. All service pages have been redesigned to match a professional B2B format targeting property managers, including new schema fields for richer content.

### Technical Implementations
The frontend is built with React 18 and Wouter for routing. SEO is a core focus, implemented with `react-helmet-async` for dynamic meta tags, a robust JSON-LD schema (LocalBusiness, FAQPage, BreadcrumbList), and enhanced Organization schema. The backend uses Express.js and Node.js 20, handling API routes for articles and contact form submissions with in-memory storage and Zod for input validation. Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and Google Search Console (GSC) are integrated for analytics, featuring asynchronous loading and detailed event tracking. Performance optimizations include code splitting with `React.lazy()`, font optimization, and icon tree-shaking to achieve high PageSpeed scores.

### Feature Specifications

- **Service Showcase**: Detailed pages for construction services with professional images, focusing on emergency services, now expanded to 12 services (6 primary, 6 secondary).

- **Safety & Certifications**: Showcases OSHA compliance, licenses across multiple states, insurance, bonding, and awards.
- **Testimonials**: Filterable by service type, with 5-star ratings, now prepared for real client testimonials with placeholder content removed.
- **Enhanced Homepage**: Includes a stats bar, featured projects, and content targeted at property managers, with a focus on brevity.
- **Advanced SEO**: Dynamic meta tags, JSON-LD schema, breadcrumb navigation on 15 pages, XML sitemap, `robots.txt`, and comprehensive internal linking strategy.
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Descriptive aria-labels for navigation, CTAs, forms, and interactive elements.

### System Design Choices
The project utilizes a component-based architecture for the frontend, promoting reusability. A design system defines colors, typography, and responsiveness, leveraging Shadcn UI. The backend is designed as a lightweight API server. Several pages and sections are temporarily hidden, with code preserved for future re-enablement.

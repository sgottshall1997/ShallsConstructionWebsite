## Services Considered But NOT Included

### general-maintenance
- **Status:** MERGED into handyman-services
- **Reason:** Too similar to handyman-services. Would cause confusion. General maintenance tasks are better served under the "Handyman Services" umbrella which is more recognizable to property managers.

### hauling-services
- **Status:** NOT INCLUDED as standalone service
- **Reason:** Hauling/debris removal is a component of demolition, construction, and handyman services rather than a standalone offering. Will be mentioned within relevant service pages but doesn't merit its own page.

### mission-critical-services
- **Status:** NOT INCLUDED as standalone service
- **Reason:** "Mission critical" is a service approach/methodology rather than a service type. This concept should be woven into emergency-services, facility-maintenance, and construction-remodeling content to emphasize reliability for critical infrastructure.

SHALL'S CONSTRUCTION SITE POLISH & SEO
0) Operating Mode
Work deterministically. No experiments. No redesign beyond what's specified.
Don't delete or rename existing pages, components, or routes.
Don't change phone numbers, emails, or existing URLs.
Don't alter navigation labels or order unless explicitly stated.
Don't minify or reformat unrelated files.
No tests. I will test manually.
All edits must be idempotent: running this task twice must not duplicate content.
1) Repo Context - UPDATED FOR YOUR SITE
Current Architecture:

React + TypeScript + Vite application
Routes defined in client/src/App.tsx
SEO component at client/src/components/SEO.tsx (uses react-helmet-async)
Schema generation at client/src/lib/schema.ts
Shared layout components: client/src/components/Navigation.tsx and client/src/components/Footer.tsx
Existing Routes:

Home: / → client/src/pages/Home.tsx
About: /about → client/src/pages/About.tsx
Who We Serve: /who-we-serve → client/src/pages/WhoWeServe.tsx
What We Do: /what-we-do → client/src/pages/WhatWeDo.tsx (contains service anchors)
Projects: /projects → client/src/pages/Projects.tsx
Contact: /contact → client/src/pages/Contact.tsx
Safety: /safety → client/src/pages/Safety.tsx
Service Areas: /service-areas/* → Individual files in client/src/pages/ServiceAreas/
Note: Service pages are currently implemented as anchor sections within /what-we-do, NOT separate routes. If you need dedicated service routes, create them as:

client/src/pages/Services/ConstructionRemodeling.tsx
client/src/pages/Services/HandymanServices.tsx
etc.
Action: Inventory the repo and confirm exact structure before making changes.

2) Global Changes - UPDATED FOR REACT
2.1 Head tags: meta + canonical + basic OG
Use the existing <SEO /> component in client/src/components/SEO.tsx. For each page:

Ensure unique title prop passed to <SEO />
Add page-specific description prop (see Section 6 templates)
Canonical URLs are already handled by the SEO component
Open Graph tags are already implemented in the SEO component
Example:

<SEO
  title="Commercial Construction & Remodeling | Shall's Construction"
  description="Shall's Construction delivers tenant build-outs, office renovations..."
  canonical="https://shallsconstruction.replit.app/services/construction-remodeling"
/>
2.2 JSON-LD Schema
Use the existing schema functions in client/src/lib/schema.ts:

Organization schema is already implemented via generateOrganizationSchema()
Service schema via generateServiceSchema()
FAQ schema via generateFAQSchema()
Breadcrumb schema via generateBreadcrumbSchema()
Ensure schemas are included in page components:

const schemas = [
  generateOrganizationSchema(),
  generateServiceSchema({
    name: "Commercial Construction & Remodeling",
    description: "...",
    url: "/services/construction-remodeling"
  }),
  generateBreadcrumbSchema([...])
];
<SEO schemas={schemas} />
2.3 Accessibility + Performance
Add loading="lazy" to non-hero <img> tags
Update alt attributes to be location-aware (see Section 4.3)
Ensure only one <h1> per page component
2.4 Internal Linking (contextual)
Add at the end of service page content (before component return closes):

<nav className="related-links mt-12 border-t pt-8" aria-label="Related services">
  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">Related Services</h3>
  <ul className="space-y-2">
    <li><Link href="/what-we-do#exterior">Exterior Building Services</Link></li>
    <li><Link href="/what-we-do#handyman">Handyman Services</Link></li>
    <li><Link href="/contact">Contact Us</Link></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
2.5 CTA Standardization
Insert uniform CTA block as a React component:

<section className="cta-block bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-8 my-12" id="cta-standard">
  <h2 className="text-3xl font-heading font-bold text-center mb-6">
    Ready to Start Your Project?
  </h2>
  <div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4 justify-center mb-6">
    <Link href="/contact?type={service-slug}">
      <Button size="lg" className="btn-primary">Request a Quote</Button>
    </Link>
    <a href="tel:+13019336277" aria-label="Call for emergency 24/7 commercial service">
      <Button size="lg" variant="outline">Emergency Help 24/7</Button>
    </a>
  </div>
  <p className="text-center text-gray-600">
    <a href="tel:+13019336277" className="hover:text-primary">(301) 933-6277</a>
    {" · "}
    <a href="mailto:shallsconstructionllc@aol.com" className="hover:text-primary">
      shallsconstructionllc@aol.com
    </a>
  </p>
</section>
2.6 Footer Cleanup
Footer is in client/src/components/Footer.tsx. Leave placeholder logos as-is unless duplicated.

3) Fix Known Copy Issues
Check client/src/pages/WhatWeDo.tsx for duplicate headings like "Services Services Include" and fix with regex or manual edits.

4) Visual Enhancements - UPDATED FOR REACT
4.1 Hero Banner Injection
Create a reusable Hero component or add directly to service pages:

<section className="hero mb-12">
  <figure className="hero-media relative h-96 rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
    <img
      src="/media/commercial-remodeling-bethesda.jpg"
      alt="Office renovation and tenant build-out in Bethesda by Shall's Construction"
      width={1600}
      height={700}
      className="w-full h-full object-cover"
    />
    <div className="hero-tagline absolute bottom-0 left-0 right-0 bg-gradient-to-t from-black/70 to-transparent p-6">
      <p className="text-white text-2xl font-bold">Full-Service Build-Outs & Renovations</p>
    </div>
  </figure>
</section>
Note: If /media/*.jpg files don't exist in public/ directory, create placeholder references only.

4.2 Lists → Semantic hooks
Wrap existing service lists in WhatWeDo.tsx:

<section className="feature-grid">
  {/* existing bullet lists */}
</section>
4.3 Image alt normalization
Update all <img> tags in service sections to include location context.

5) Page-Specific JSON-LD
If creating dedicated service pages, use the existing schema helper:

const serviceSchema = generateServiceSchema({
  name: "Commercial Construction & Remodeling",
  description: "Tenant buildouts, office renovations, and common-area upgrades",
  url: "/services/construction-remodeling",
  areaServed: ["Montgomery County, MD", "Bethesda, MD", "Kensington, MD", "Washington, DC", "Northern Virginia", "Delaware"]
});
6) Meta Description Templates
Update SEO component calls with these descriptions:

Construction & Remodeling: "Shall's Construction delivers tenant build-outs, office renovations, and capital upgrades across MD, VA, DC, and DE. 30+ years. 100% in-house."
Handyman Services: "Fast, in-house commercial handyman services in Montgomery County and the DC Metro. Drywall, doors, fixtures, minor MEP, and 24/7 emergencies."
Exterior Building Services: "Waterproofing, facade restoration, sealants, and masonry repair for DC-area commercial buildings. Extend envelope life with expert crews."
Parking Lot Services: "Asphalt, concrete, sealcoating, striping, and ADA upgrades for commercial lots across MD, VA, and DC. Reliable, safety-focused service."
Painting Services: "Interior/exterior commercial painting, drywall finishing, epoxy, and wall coverings across the DC Metro. Minimal tenant disruption."
Snow Removal: "24/7 commercial snow & ice management in Montgomery County and the DC Metro. Pre-storm planning, plowing, salting, sidewalks."
About: "Family-owned commercial contractor serving MD, VA, DC, and DE for 30+ years. 100% in-house crews. Built for property managers."
Who We Serve: "Partner to property managers across MD, VA, DC, and DE for renovation, maintenance, and 24/7 emergency work."
Home: "Commercial construction, property maintenance, and 24/7 emergency response across MD, VA, DC, and DE. Family-owned for 30+ years."
7-8) Service Pages Implementation
OPTION A: If keeping services within /what-we-do as anchors:

Add hero sections, CTAs, and related links to each anchor section
Update meta description for the What We Do page
OPTION B: If creating dedicated service routes:

Create files in client/src/pages/Services/
Add routes to App.tsx
Implement each with hero, content, CTA, related links, and schema
Update navigation to link to new routes
9) Who We Serve — Minimal Upgrades
File: client/src/pages/WhoWeServe.tsx

Add hero section with specified content
Add CTA block linking to /contact?type=property-manager
Add related links nav
Leave client logos as-is
10) About — Minimal Upgrades
File: client/src/pages/About.tsx

Replace placeholder hero section if present
Ensure meta description is set via SEO component
11) Breadcrumbs
Already implemented via generateBreadcrumbSchema() - ensure used on all subpages.

12) Safety Checks
No duplicate heroes or CTAs
One H1 per page component
One Service schema per service page (if applicable)
Organization schema called once globally
Tel/email links consistent: tel:+13019336277 and mailto:shallsconstructionllc@aol.com
Canonical URLs match routes
13) Deliverable: Change Report
Provide markdown report with:

File paths changed
Sections added per file (Hero/CTA/Schema/Meta)
Heading fixes (before/after)
Meta description updates
Lazy loading implementation notes
Confirmation of idempotency
End of updated prompt. Execute as specified, adapting to React/TypeScript patterns.

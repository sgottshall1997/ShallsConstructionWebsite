Goal: Elevate all weak SEO areas (meta descriptions, structured data, canonicals, sitemap, robots, content completeness) to professional grade. Skip domain/SSL changes.

Phase A – Meta & Canonical Repair

Audit: Enumerate every route under / – /about, /what-we-do, /projects, /who-we-serve, /service-areas/*, /testimonials, /safety, /blog, /articles, /contact.

Insert unique <meta name="description"> per page (140–160 chars):

Home → “Commercial construction, remodeling, handyman, asphalt, painting, and snow services across MD VA DC DE — 30 years serving property managers.”

About → “Learn the story, leadership, and values behind Shall’s Construction — trusted by property managers for three decades.”

Each Service Page → Summarize service + regions.

Each Service-Area Page → “Full-service commercial contractor for [City ST] office, retail, and multifamily properties.”

Projects → “Explore commercial project case studies across MD VA DC DE.”

Testimonials → “Read verified property-manager reviews of Shall’s Construction’s reliability and workmanship.”

Blog → “Industry tips and maintenance insights for commercial property managers.”

Contact → “Request a quote or 24/7 emergency service — licensed MD VA DC DE.”

Add <link rel="canonical" href="https://shallsconstruction.replit.app[exact path]"> to each page’s <head>.

Confirm one <h1> per page; demote duplicates to <h2>.

Phase B – Structured Data (JSON-LD)

Insert inside <head> blocks or via a global SEO component. Validate all with Google’s Rich Results Test.

 "itemListElement":[
  {"@type":"ListItem","position":1,"name":"Home","item":"https://shallsconstruction.replit.app"},
  {"@type":"ListItem","position":2,"name":"{{Current Page Name}}","item":"{{Current URL}}"}
 ]
}


FAQPage – Add to /what-we-do or /safety using visible Q&A.

{
 "@context":"https://schema.org",
 "@type":"Review",
 "author":{"@type":"Person","name":"{{Client Name}}"},
 "reviewBody":"{{Quoted Testimonial}}",
 "reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5,"bestRating":5},
 "itemReviewed":{"@type":"LocalBusiness","name":"Shall's Construction LLC"}
}


BlogPosting – Add to each blog article.

Phase C – Sitemap + Robots

Generate /sitemap.xml automatically listing all canonical URLs with <lastmod> timestamps.

Create /robots.txt:

User-agent: *
Disallow:
Sitemap: https://shallsconstruction.replit.app/sitemap.xml

Phase D – Content Depth & Placeholder Elimination

Service Pages: Minimum 400–600 words each. Use subheads: “Overview,” “Key Capabilities,” “Typical Clients,” “Recent Projects,” “FAQs.”

Service-Area Pages: 350–450 words, include city-specific references and a single embedded map (<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?...">).

Projects: Replace [Add project description] placeholders with at least 150 words each and 2–3 optimized photos (alt="Office build-out in Bethesda MD").

Client Logos: Replace [Client Logo 1] etc. with actual image tags and descriptive alt text.

Ensure internal links between services, projects, and service-areas.

Phase E – Quality Verification

Run a full audit after changes:

Validate JSON-LD in Rich Results Test → 0 errors, 0 warnings.

Lighthouse SEO ≥ 95, Accessibility ≥ 90.

Confirm <title>, <meta>, <h1> uniqueness via script.

Confirm sitemap.xml and robots.txt accessible in browser.

Generate final report: table of each page with title | meta | h1 | schema types | word count | status.

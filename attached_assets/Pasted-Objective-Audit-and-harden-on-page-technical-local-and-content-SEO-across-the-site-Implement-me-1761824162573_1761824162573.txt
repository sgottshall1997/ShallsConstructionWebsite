Any other discovered routes

0) Repository Discovery

Detect framework (pure HTML, templating, or React/Vite). Identify layout file(s) controlling <head> and navigation/footer.

Enumerate all routes/pages. Output a table: path | file | title(h1) | current <title> | meta description | word count | has schema? | images(count) | anchors | status.

1) Global <head> Baseline (in the shared layout/template)

Implement once globally; allow page-level overrides:

<meta charset="utf-8">

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

Default <title> fallback: Shall’s Construction | Commercial Property Services in MD · VA · DC · DE

Default <meta name="description"> fallback: Commercial construction, remodeling, handyman, exterior building, asphalt & concrete, painting, and snow removal services. 30+ years. 24/7 emergency response.

<link rel="canonical" href="[absolute URL of current route]"> (programmatic)

Open Graph/Twitter defaults:

og:type=website, og:site_name=Shall’s Construction

og:title and og:description mirror page <title>/description

og:image and twitter:image to a branded 1200×630 image

twitter:card=summary_large_image

<link rel="icon" ...> and <link rel="manifest" ...> if available

3) Heading Hierarchy Fix

Exactly one <h1> per page that states the core query/topic.

Convert section titles to <h2>, subsections <h3>.

Ensure anchors map to headings with IDs.

4) Copy Depth Targets

Home: ≥ 500–700 words of unique copy distributed by sections.

Each service (own page or deep section): ≥ 400–600 words including: scope, methods, materials, timelines, risks, QA, and 3–5 FAQs.

Each service-area page: ≥ 400–600 words including local references, example projects, neighborhoods, seasonal issues.

Projects: turn each “Featured Project” into a distinct page with 250–500 words: Client type, location, problem, scope, materials, timeline, before/after outcomes, photos.

Blog: ensure each post ≥ 800–1200 words, with skimmable subheads and an FAQ.

5) Internal Linking Plan

From Home and service pages, link to at least 2 relevant service-area pages with descriptive anchors (e.g., office remodeling in Bethesda).

From service-area pages, link back to relevant service pages and 1–2 local case studies.

From blog posts, link to related services and service-areas; add a “Related Articles” block (3 links).

Ensure breadcrumb navigation on all subpages.

6) Media & Image Optimization

Rename files to descriptive, keyworded names (e.g., bethesda-office-remodel-tenant-fitout.jpg).

Generate WebP versions; keep original as fallback via <picture> where possible.

Add precise alt attributes; pattern: [Subject] — [Service] in [City/Region] by Shall’s Construction (no stuffing).

Set explicit width/height, lazy-load non-hero images.

Compress images (target <200KB when possible without visible loss).

7) Structured Data (JSON-LD)

Implement JSON-LD blocks in the <head>:

Organization/LocalBusiness on Home:

@type: LocalBusiness

name, url, telephone = (301) 933-6277, email = shallsconstructionllc@aol.com

areaServed: list of MD, VA, DC, DE and key cities (Bethesda, Rockville, Silver Spring, Baltimore, Gaithersburg, DC Metro)

openingHoursSpecification for 24/7 emergency

logo, sameAs (add profiles if exist)

hasOfferCatalog with entries for each service category

Service on each service page/section: describe the service, areaServed, provider pointing to Organization.

BreadcrumbList on all subpages.

FAQPage on any page with FAQs.

Review (not AggregateRating unless you have verifiable counts). Add individual Review items that match visible testimonials.

BlogPosting for blog posts.

Validate with Rich Results Test; fix errors/warnings.

8) Canonicals, Duplicates, Redirects

If both /blog and /articles exist, choose one canonical path (prefer /blog).

Add canonical tags on posts and listing pages.

If you change slugs, create 301 redirects from old → new (in whatever routing layer the repo uses).

Ensure only one URL per content (no trailing slash/uppercase/querystring duplicates); normalize.

9) Sitemap & Robots

Generate sitemap.xml including all canonical routes and lastmod dates.

Create/update robots.txt with:

User-agent: *
Disallow:
Sitemap: https://shallsconstruction.replit.app/sitemap.xml


Exclude non-canonical/utility routes.

10) Accessibility & UX Signals

Add aria-labels on nav and buttons.

Ensure color contrast passes WCAG AA.

Ensure buttons have descriptive text (“Request a Quote for [Service/City]”).

Add tel: and mailto: links where appropriate.

Add a fast, uncluttered mobile menu.

11) Performance (non-hosting)

Inlining critical CSS for above-the-fold if feasible.

Defer noncritical scripts; remove unused libraries.

Preload hero image; lazy-load below-the-fold.

Use CSS aspect-ratio for media to prevent CLS.

12) Content Production Queue (create as /content/plan.md)

Produce a 12-week plan. Include 3 blog posts/week targeting property-manager intent in MD/VA/DC/DE. Examples:

“Office Tenant Build-Out: Permit & Timeline Checklist for Bethesda, MD”

“Parking Lot Sealcoating: How Often for Retail Centers in Rockville?”

“Medical Office Remodels: Infection Control Measures Property Managers Need”

“Commercial Waterproofing: Diagnosing Leaks in 1970s Brick Facades (DC Metro)”
For each item: target keyword, H1, H2 outline, brief, internal links, CTA.

13) QA & Self-Check (output a final report)

Verify every page has:

Exactly one <h1>, unique <title> (50–60 chars), unique meta description (140–160 chars).

Canonical tag.

At least 2 internal links to relevant pages.

Images with descriptive filenames and non-generic alt.

Appropriate schema with zero Rich Results errors.

Run Lighthouse (or equivalent) and report: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO.

Validate sitemap.xml and robots.txt.

Print a diff summary of files changed.

Implementation Notes

Do not invent addresses. Use city/region in areaServed; keep NAP exactly as displayed on site.

Keep phone (301) 933-6277 consistent.

If the site is React/Vite: implement a useSEO() helper and page-level SEO objects; otherwise inject per-page <head> sections.

If anchors remain on /what-we-do, still add section-level schema (it’s valid). If you can split into proper routes, prefer that, with redirects from the old anchors.

Deliverables:

Updated code with global <head> and page-level overrides.

JSON-LD blocks for Organization, Service, BreadcrumbList, FAQ, BlogPosting, Reviews.

Optimized images (renamed, compressed, WebP where possible).

sitemap.xml and robots.txt.

/content/plan.md with 12-week calendar and 36+ briefs.

Final QA report (table from Step 0 updated post-fix; Lighthouse/validator notes; list of remaining gaps).

REPLIT AGENT PROMPT — SHALL’S CONSTRUCTION SITE POLISH & SEO
0) Operating Mode


Work deterministically. No experiments. No redesign beyond what’s specified.


Don’t delete or rename existing pages, components, or routes.


Don’t change phone numbers, emails, or existing URLs.


Don’t alter navigation labels or order unless explicitly stated.


Don’t minify or reformat unrelated files.


No tests. I will test manually.


All edits must be idempotent: running this task twice must not duplicate content.


1) Repo Context Assumptions (adjust only if you find exact names differ)


Static site or small framework serving routes:


Home: /index.html or /pages/index.html


About: /about/index.html


Who We Serve: /who-we-serve/index.html


Services index: /services/index.html (if present)


Service pages:


/services/construction-remodeling/index.html


/services/handyman-services/index.html


/services/exterior-building-services/index.html


/services/parking-lot-services/index.html


/services/painting-services/index.html


/services/snow-removal/index.html




Contact: /contact/index.html




Shared layout (header/footer) likely in a partial (e.g., /partials/header.html, /partials/footer.html) or duplicated across pages.


Action: Inventory the repo. In your report, list exact file paths for the pages above and whether the site uses partials or duplicated markup.
2) Global Changes (apply only where relevant; do not touch unrelated code)
2.1 Head tags: meta + canonical + basic OG
For each page, ensure:


One <title> already exists — do not change unless empty or nonsense.


Add/ensure a page-specific meta description (see Section 6 templates).


Add <link rel="canonical" href="https://shallsconstruction.replit.app{PAGE_PATH}">


Add basic Open Graph tags:
<meta property="og:type" content="website">
<meta property="og:title" content="{TITLE}">
<meta property="og:description" content="{META_DESCRIPTION}">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://shallsconstruction.replit.app{PAGE_PATH}">



If there is already a canonical or OG block, update values only; do not duplicate tags.


2.2 JSON-LD Schema


Organization schema: Include once sitewide (preferably in the header or footer partial). If already present, update values; do not duplicate.
<script type="application/ld+json" id="ld-org">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "Shall's Construction LLC",
  "url": "https://shallsconstruction.replit.app",
  "logo": "https://shallsconstruction.replit.app/shalls-construction-logo-DYaZi169.png",
  "areaServed": ["MD","VA","DC","DE"],
  "contactPoint": [{
    "@type": "ContactPoint",
    "telephone": "+1-301-933-6277",
    "contactType": "customer service",
    "areaServed": "US"
  }]
}
</script>



Service schema: Add per service page (details in Section 5).


2.3 Accessibility + Performance


Add loading="lazy" to all non-critical images below the fold. Keep the hero image without lazy if it’s the first view.


Add alt text that is descriptive and location-aware (Section 4.3).


Ensure only one <h1> per page; demote extras to <h2>.


2.4 Internal Linking (contextual)
At the end of each service body (before footer), add a small related-links block:
<nav class="related-links" aria-label="Related services">
  <p>Related services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/services/exterior-building-services">Exterior Building Services</a></li>
    <li><a href="/services/handyman-services">Handyman Services</a></li>
    <li><a href="/contact">Contact Us</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>

Adjust links logically per page (e.g., Parking Lot page should link Exterior Building Services, Contact, Construction & Remodeling).
2.5 CTA Standardization (footer of content area, not the global footer)
Insert uniform CTA block on every service page right above the page footer:
<section class="cta-block" id="cta-standard">
  <h2>Ready to Start Your Project?</h2>
  <div class="cta-actions">
    <a class="btn btn-primary" href="/contact?type={service-slug}">Request a Quote</a>
    <a class="btn btn-secondary" href="tel:+13019336277" aria-label="Call for emergency 24/7 commercial service">Emergency Help 24/7</a>
  </div>
  <p><a href="tel:+13019336277">(301) 933-6277</a> · <a href="mailto:shallsconstructionllc@aol.com">shallsconstructionllc@aol.com</a></p>
</section>



Use the appropriate {service-slug} (e.g., construction-remodeling, handyman-services, etc.).


If a similar CTA exists, replace it with this standardized block; don’t duplicate.


2.6 Footer Cleanup


If footers contain placeholder [AGC] Logo, etc., do not remove yet. Leave as-is unless you see duplicate placeholders (then keep one). No styling changes beyond removing obvious duplicate lines.


3) Fix Known Copy Issues (safe regex replacements)
Perform these scoped replacements only inside the main content area of service pages (not in header, nav, or footer):


Replace any heading that matches:


(?i)([A-Za-z\s]+)\s+Services\s+Services\s+Include: → Our $1 Services Include:




Alternative simpler catch-all if the above doesn’t match reliably:


(?i)Services\s+Services\s+Include: → Our Services Include:




Ensure no heading ends with a colon and is immediately followed by a duplicate colon.


Log the exact files changed and the before/after line fragments in the report.
4) Visual Enhancements (non-destructive)
4.1 Hero Banner Injection (service pages)
Insert at the top of each service page content, right after the <h1> (if not present), a hero container:
<section class="hero">
  <figure class="hero-media">
    <img src="/media/{service-hero-filename}.jpg"
         alt="{service-hero-alt}"
         width="1600" height="700">
    <figcaption class="visually-hidden">{service-hero-alt}</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <div class="hero-tagline">{service-hero-tagline}</div>
</section>

Do not add CSS; only markup. Use the content values below:


Construction & Remodeling:


filename: commercial-remodeling-bethesda


alt: Office renovation and tenant build-out in Bethesda by Shall’s Construction


tagline: Full-Service Build-Outs & Renovations




Handyman Services:


filename: handyman-services-montgomery-county


alt: Technician performing commercial repair in Montgomery County office


tagline: Fast, Tenant-Friendly Repairs




Exterior Building Services:


filename: exterior-restoration-dc


alt: Facade restoration and waterproofing on a DC commercial property


tagline: Waterproofing & Facade Restoration




Parking Lot Services:


filename: parking-lot-resurfacing-bethesda


alt: Resurfacing and striping commercial parking lot in Bethesda


tagline: Asphalt • Concrete • ADA




Painting Services:


filename: commercial-painting-dc-office


alt: Interior office repaint in Washington, DC


tagline: Interior & Exterior Finishes




Snow Removal:


filename: snow-removal-montgomery-county


alt: Snow plow clearing commercial lot in Montgomery County


tagline: 24/7/365 Snow & Ice Response




Important: If /media/*.jpg files don’t exist, create empty references only (placeholders). Do not upload or embed base64. Do not alter <img src> paths elsewhere.
4.2 Lists → Semantic hooks
Wrap existing bullet lists in a container for later styling (no CSS now):
<section class="feature-grid">
  <!-- existing <ul> or bullets remain; just ensure it's inside this section -->
</section>

4.3 Image alt normalization
For each existing <img> in service bodies with generic alt text, update alt to include service + location where obvious. Do not change logos or decorative separators. Skip the site logo.
5) Page-Specific JSON-LD (Service schema)
Add one service schema per service page (insert before </body> or near the CTA block). If a Service schema exists, update values, don’t duplicate.
Use this generic pattern and customize per page:
<script type="application/ld+json" class="ld-service">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Service",
  "serviceType": "{Service Name}",
  "provider": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Shall's Construction LLC",
    "url": "https://shallsconstruction.replit.app"
  },
  "areaServed": [
    "Montgomery County, MD", "Bethesda, MD", "Kensington, MD",
    "Washington, DC", "Northern Virginia", "Delaware"
  ],
  "availableChannel": {
    "@type": "ServiceChannel",
    "serviceUrl": "https://shallsconstruction.replit.app{PAGE_PATH}",
    "servicePhone": "+1-301-933-6277"
  },
  "hoursAvailable": {
    "@type": "OpeningHoursSpecification",
    "dayOfWeek": ["Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday"],
    "opens": "00:00", "closes": "23:59"
  }
}
</script>

Service Name values:

7) Reference Implementation — Apply to /services/construction-remodeling
Make these exact edits in the Construction & Remodeling page:


Ensure single <h1> is: Commercial Construction & Remodeling. Demote any duplicate big headings to <h2>.


Inject Hero section (Section 4.1) immediately after the <h1> with the specified filename/alt/tagline for this service.


Fix the duplicate heading issue via regex (Section 3).


Wrap the services bullet list with <section class="feature-grid">...</section>.


Add the Related links nav (Section 2.4) below the main body.


Add the CTA block (Section 2.5) above the footer.


Insert Service schema (Section 5) before </body>.


Ensure meta description exists (Section 6) and add canonical + OG tags (Section 2.1).


Add loading="lazy" to non-hero images on the page.


Verify phone mailto/tel links match:




tel:+13019336277


mailto:shallsconstructionllc@aol.com


Do not change existing shallsconstruction@gmail.com occurrences in footer; leave them.


Report: Provide before/after snippets for:


The fixed “Services Services Include” heading.


The insertion point for the hero section.


The CTA block insertion.


8) Replicate for Other Service Pages
Perform the same steps (7.1 → 7.10) for:


/services/handyman-services


/services/exterior-building-services


/services/parking-lot-services


/services/painting-services


/services/snow-removal


Use the correct hero filename/alt/tagline from Section 4.1, adjust related links smartly, and use each page’s matching meta description from Section 6.
9) Who We Serve — Minimal Upgrades Only


Add one hero block (use filename property-management-construction-services-maryland.jpg, alt Partnering with property managers on commercial projects in Maryland, tagline Built for Property Managers).


Insert a CTA block (Section 2.5) linking to /contact?type=property-manager.


Do not add Service schema here. Keep Organization schema global only.


Add a small Related links nav to Services + Projects + Contact.


Leave placeholder client logos intact. Do not attempt image replacement.


10) About — Minimal Upgrades Only


If there is a [Add hero image ...] placeholder, replace it with the Hero section using filename team-or-yard-hero.jpg, alt Shall’s Construction in-house team serving the DC Metro, tagline Family-Owned. 100% In-House..


Add meta description (Section 6).


Do not add Service schema here (Organization is already global).


11) Breadcrumbs (Optional if time allows, but safe)
If the pages already show breadcrumb links in-body, leave them. Do not add JSON-LD breadcrumb schema unless a consistent breadcrumb nav exists across pages.
12) Safety Checks (triple-check pass)
For every edited file:


Confirm no duplicated hero or CTA blocks.


Confirm one <h1> per page.


Confirm only one Service schema per service page.


Confirm one Organization schema sitewide (if partials duplicated it across pages, add id="ld-org" and ensure it appears once per DOM; if it appears on each page due to shared layout, that is acceptable, but do not add a second copy).


Confirm tel/email links are correct and unchanged elsewhere.


Confirm canonical URLs match each page path.


Confirm all new HTML validates (no unclosed tags).


13) Deliverable: Change Report
Output a concise markdown report with:


File inventory of the pages you changed (exact paths).


For each file:


Which sections were added (Hero / Related Links / CTA / Schema / Meta).


Any headings fixed (show the one-line before → after).


New meta description line.


Presence of loading="lazy" where applicable.




Confirm idempotency: running the same steps again will not duplicate structures.



End of prompt. Execute exactly as written.

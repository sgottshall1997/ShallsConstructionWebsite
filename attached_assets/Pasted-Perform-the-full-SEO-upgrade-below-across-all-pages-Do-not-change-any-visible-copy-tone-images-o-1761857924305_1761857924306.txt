4️⃣ Accessibility & Image Optimization


Add loading="lazy" to all non-hero <img> elements.


Ensure every <img> has descriptive, location-based alt text (e.g., “Commercial waterproofing project in Bethesda, MD”).


Confirm only one <h1> per page. All sub-sections use <h2> or <h3>.


Verify phone links: href="tel:+13019336277" everywhere for consistency.



5️⃣ Internal Linking Boost


At the end of every service page, under “Related Services,” ensure at least 3 links exist:


To another service page


To “Who We Serve”


To “Contact Us”




On About and Who We Serve, add one inline link to /services/construction-remodeling.


On Home, ensure every service card links to the proper URL and uses keyword-friendly anchor text (<a href="/services/handyman-services">Commercial Handyman Services</a>).



6️⃣ Local SEO Enhancements


Add <meta name="geo.region" content="US-MD"> and <meta name="geo.placename" content="Montgomery County"> in the head of every page.

<address>
  <strong>Shall's Construction LLC</strong><br>
  Kensington, Maryland<br>
  (301) 933-6277<br>
  shallsconstruction@gmail.com
</address>



Add hidden local list markup (visible to search crawlers, not users):
<!-- Local Service Areas -->
<ul hidden>
  <li>Commercial Contractor Bethesda MD</li>
  <li>Commercial Contractor Rockville MD</li>
  <li>Commercial Contractor Silver Spring MD</li>
  <li>Commercial Property Maintenance DC</li>
